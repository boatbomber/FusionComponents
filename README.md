# FusionComponents

A library of handy Fusion components

## Usage

## Theme

The theme is a table of [State](https://elttob.github.io/Fusion/api-reference/api/state/) objects, with each key being the name of an Enum.StudioStyleGuideColor item.

If FusionComponents is required from within a Studio plugin, the theme values will automatically be loaded and synced with Studio's. Otherwise, it defaults to Studio's dark theme and you are free to alter the values however you want.
